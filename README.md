# Social Media Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves simulating and analyzing social media data using Python. The primary goal is to generate random data for social media posts, clean and explore the data, and perform various visualizations and statistical analyses to derive meaningful insights.

## Installation

To get started with the project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/social-media-data-analysis.git
cd social-media-data-analysis
```

Run the script to execute the project tasks:

```bash
python social_media_analysis.py
```

## Project Tasks

### Task 1 – Import Required Libraries

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import random
```

### Task 2 – Generate Random Data for the Social Media Data

```python
# Define categories
categories = ['Food', 'Travel', 'Fashion', 'Fitness', 'Music', 'Culture', 'Family', 'Health']

# Generate random data
n = 500  # Number of data points
data = {
    'Date': pd.date_range('2021-01-01', periods=n),
    'Category': [random.choice(categories) for _ in range(n)],
    'Likes': np.random.randint(0, 10000, size=n)
}

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

### Task 3 – Load the Data into a Pandas DataFrame and Explore the Data

```python
# Print DataFrame head
print(df.head())

# Print DataFrame info
print(df.info())

# Print DataFrame description
print(df.describe())

# Print count of each Category element
print(df['Category'].value_counts())
```

### Task 4 – Clean the Data

```python
# Remove null data
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Remove duplicate data
df.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Convert 'Date' field to datetime format
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])

# Convert 'Likes' data to an integer
df['Likes'] = df['Likes'].astype(int)
```

### Task 5 – Visualize and Analyze the Data

```python
# Visualize data with histogram using distplot
sns.distplot(df['Likes'], bins=30, kde=False)
plt.title('Histogram of Likes')
plt.xlabel('Likes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()

# Create a boxplot
sns.boxplot(x='Category', y='Likes', data=df)
plt.title('Boxplot of Likes by Category')
plt.xlabel('Category')
plt.ylabel('Likes')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

# Compute and print the mean of the 'Likes' category
print('Mean of Likes:', df['Likes'].mean())

# Group by 'Category' and compute the mean of 'Likes'
print(df.groupby('Category')['Likes'].mean())
```

### Task 6 – Describe Conclusions

### Conclusion

In this project, we simulated social media data and performed several key steps to analyze it. We started by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and random. We then generated random data for 500 social media posts with categories and likes.

We loaded this data into a Pandas DataFrame, explored it by printing the first few rows, data info, statistical summary, and counts of each category. Next, we cleaned the data by removing null and duplicate values, and ensuring the correct data types for each field.

To analyze the data, we visualized it using histograms and boxplots, which helped us observe the distribution of likes and their relationship with different categories. Finally, we performed statistical analysis to compute the mean likes overall and within each category.

The process involved several challenges, including ensuring data alignment and proper formatting for visualization. Overcoming these challenges required careful handling of data types and leveraging pandas' powerful data manipulation capabilities.

This project highlights my ability to work with data, clean it, visualize it, and derive meaningful insights. Future improvements could include generating more complex data patterns, integrating real-world data sources, and applying more advanced statistical methods to uncover deeper trends and patterns.

**Artifacts:**
- Images of graphs and statistics.
- Excerpts from the code with explanations.
- Suggestions for future improvements.
